## Reporting Bugs
We'd like to start by thanking anyone who puts in the time to report bugs, but there are some easy guidelines which need to be followed.

* Before filing a report, check to see if there's already a related report.
  * If we don't get duplicates, we don't have to spend time working on those reports.
* Use a clear title.
  * This makes it easier to identify the issue at a glance.
* Describe the exact steps needed to cause an issue.
  * Some bugs can be hard to find, so giving us information on how to find them can help.

## Filing Pull Requests.
Again, we'd also like to thank anyone who files pull requests, and some more easy guidelines.

* You must have the rights to the content you submit.
  * Because we require a license to use your content, you must have right to issue that license.
* Use a clear title.
